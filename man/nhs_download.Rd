\title{Download NHS England data for a specified statistical area}
\usage{
nhs_download(area, dest = ".", skip_existing = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{area}{Character string. The name of the statistical area to download,
matching an entry in the YAML config (e.g. \code{"rtt"}).}

\item{dest}{Character string. Folder path where downloaded files will be saved.
Will be created if it does not exist.}

\item{skip_existing}{Logical. Whether to avoid re-downloading files that
already exist in the \code{dest} folder. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per file, containing:
\describe{
\item{dl_link}{The URL of the downloaded (or skipped) file}
\item{dest_name}{Relative path to downloaded file (best on \code{dest}).}
\item{file_name}{The filename portion of the download}
\item{pre_existing}{TRUE if the file already existed before download}
\item{success}{TRUE if the download succeeded; NA if skipped}
\item{time}{Download duration in seconds (NA if skipped)}
}
}
\description{
Downloads one or more files from NHS England's published statistics website
for a given statistical work area (e.g., referral-to-treatment, A&E, diagnostics).
This function uses a recursive pattern-matching approach to locate file links
from area-specific web pages defined in a YAML configuration file.
}
\details{
If \code{skip_existing} is \code{TRUE}, files already present in the destination
directory will be skipped. A metadata data frame is returned summarising
all discovered files and their download status.
