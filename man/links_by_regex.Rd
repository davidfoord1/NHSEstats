\title{Recursively extract nested links using regex patterns}
\usage{
links_by_regex(urls, patterns, depth = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{urls}{Character vector of URLs to search. At the top level, this will
typically be a single page URL; at deeper levels, it represents pages
matched from a previous pattern.}

\item{patterns}{Character vector of regular expression patterns to apply.
The function applies one pattern per recursion depth. The final pattern
should match the actual downloadable files (e.g., ZIPs), and earlier
patterns should match nested page URLs (e.g., year or month pages).}

\item{depth}{Integer indicating the current recursion level (used internally).
Users should not normally need to set this manually.}
}
\value{
A nested list structure:
\itemize{
\item At the last level, a character vector of matched file URLs.
\item At intermediate levels, a named list where each name is a matched URL and
each value is the result of the next recursive step.
}
}
\description{
Performs a recursive link search starting from one or more input URLs,
applying a sequence of regular expression patterns to progressively filter
and descend into nested web pages. Each pattern in the \code{patterns} vector
corresponds to a depth level in the traversal.
}
\details{
The last pattern is expected to be for download links, which are returned as
a character vector of matching links. At higher levels, it returns a named
list, where each name is a URL that matched at that depth, and each value is
the result of the recursive search beneath it.
